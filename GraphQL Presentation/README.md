### GraphQL Presentation

Ben and I chose to do our database presentation/demonstration over GraphQL.
This was the project that I put the most time into, but when it was over I felt
good about the work I did. I followed a tutorial from freecodecamp.org to
create the GraphQL server. GraphQL is a querying language, but we were able to
demonstrate a few of its really cool capabilities. We designed the schema of books
and authors that we could pull data from efficiently.
